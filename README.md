# AML Fraud Detection Pipeline

Status: Work in Progress An end-to-end data engineering and machine learning system designed to detect money laundering patterns in large-scale financial datasets.
## Overview

This project implements a Medallion Architecture to process and analyze over 5 million transactions from the [IBM AML dataset](https://ibm.ent.box.com/v/AML-Anti-Money-Laundering-Data). It transitions data from raw ingestion to refined feature sets for anomaly detection.

## Data Strategy

    Bronze : Raw ingestion of CSV data into PostgreSQL with batch tracking.

    Silver : Data cleaning, deduplication, and schema standardization.

    Gold : Feature engineering and ML model training
